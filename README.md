### What's Next? 
  - Fix it.
  - create a local Storage intance of the Projects, and Create a hook accordingly to manipulate the CRUD operations, on the entirity,
  - use unique id's for things added to the instance.
  - transitions,user options to colors, give the person options to do their own creations (connot be done within 2 days :D:D:D:D:D:D::D)
  - I'd change the "form" into markdown.
  - more validations, error boundaries (:D:D:D:D:D)

all comments are welcome.
